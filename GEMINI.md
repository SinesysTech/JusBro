# Project: JusBro (Custom Browserless Fork)

## Project Overview

This is a monorepo for **JusBro**, a custom fork of the open-source [Browserless](https://github.com/browserless/browserless) project. It is a specialized platform for automated web scraping of legal data from Brazilian courts, particularly the PJE (Processo Judicial Eletr√¥nico) system used by TRTs (Tribunais Regionais do Trabalho).

The project is composed of two main parts:

1.  **Next.js Frontend**: A modern web application built with Next.js 16, React 19, and Shadcn/ui. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing credentials, configuring and running scraping jobs, and viewing the extracted data. It uses Prisma with a SQLite database for local data persistence.
2.  **Node.js Backend**: The core of the application, based on Browserless. It manages headless browser instances (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) using Puppeteer and Playwright. This backend exposes a WebSocket endpoint for browser automation and includes specialized scripts for logging into and scraping data from the PJE system, complete with anti-bot detection mechanisms.

### Key Technologies

*   **Runtime**: Node.js v24
*   **Languages**: TypeScript 5.9, JavaScript
*   **Frontend**: Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn/ui
*   **Backend**: Express (via Browserless), Puppeteer, Playwright
*   **Database**: Prisma, SQLite (default), PostgreSQL (supported)
*   **Testing**: Mocha, c8, Playwright (for E2E)
*   **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
*   **Containerization**: Docker

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js v24.x
*   npm

### Development

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Copy the example environment file and configure it.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit `.env` to add your database URL and any necessary credentials for testing.

3.  **Run Database Migrations**:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```

4.  **Start the Development Server**:
    This command starts the Next.js frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Production

1.  **Build the Application**:
    This builds both the Next.js frontend and the Node.js backend.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Start in Production Mode**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Running Tests

*   **Run all tests**:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
*   **Run tests with code coverage**:
    ```bash
    npm run coverage
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Monorepo Structure**: The frontend code resides in the root (`app`, `components`, `lib`, etc.), while the backend Browserless code is in the `server` directory. Each has its own `tsconfig.json`.
*   **Styling**: Utility-first CSS with Tailwind CSS. UI components are built using Shadcn/ui.
*   **State Management**: Zustand is available, but the primary data flow for the frontend relies on Next.js Server Actions and Prisma for data fetching and mutations.
*   **Database**: The schema is managed with Prisma. Changes should be made in `prisma/schema.prisma`, followed by running `npx prisma migrate dev`.
*   **Code Style**: Enforced by ESLint and Prettier. Imports are automatically sorted. Follow `camelCase` for functions/variables and `PascalCase` for types/components.
*   **Commits**: Use Conventional Commits format (e.g., `feat(pje): ...`, `fix(ui): ...`).
*   **PJE Scripts**: The core scraping logic is located in `server/scripts/pje-trt/`. These are designed to be modular and reusable.
