## How Skills Work

Claude Code automatically:
1. **Discovers** skills in `.claude/skills/` directory
2. **Reads** the `SKILL.md` file when relevant
3. **Applies** the patterns and knowledge from the skill

You don't need to explicitly invoke skills - Claude will use them contextually based on your tasks.

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
.claude/skills/
└── skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Main skill definition (required)
    └── examples/         # Optional supporting files
```

### SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does (max 1024 chars)
---

# Skill Name

Detailed instructions, examples, and patterns...
```

## Testing Skills

To verify skills are working:

1. **Ask skill-specific questions:**
   ```
   "How should I structure a new PJE scraper for TJMG?"
   → Should reference pje-scraping skill
   ```

2. **Request skill-related tasks:**
   ```
   "Debug this TJMG login issue"
   → Should apply pje-login-debug patterns
   ```

3. **Create new code:**
   ```
   "Create a new React component for processos"
   → Should follow jusbro-patterns conventions
   ```

## Skill Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
- Keep skills focused on specific domains
- Include concrete examples and templates
- Update skills when patterns change
- Document when to use each skill

### ❌ Don't:
- Create overlapping skills
- Make skills too generic
- Forget to update after architectural changes
- Include sensitive data (credentials, keys)

## Maintenance

### Updating Skills

When project patterns change:

1. Edit the relevant `SKILL.md` file
2. Update examples and templates
3. Test with sample tasks
4. Commit changes to git

### Adding New Skills

To create a new skill:

```bash
# 1. Create skill directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills/new-skill-name

# 2. Create SKILL.md
cat > .claude/skills/new-skill-name/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: new-skill-name
description: What this skill does
---

# Skill Name

Instructions and patterns...
EOF

# 3. Test the skill
# Ask Claude to use the new skill patterns
```

## Integration with OpenSpec

Skills complement OpenSpec workflow:

- **OpenSpec**: Manages change proposals and specs
- **Skills**: Enforces implementation patterns

Use both together:
1. Create OpenSpec proposal for new feature
2. Use skills to implement following project patterns
3. Update skills if new patterns emerge

## Related Documentation

- [OpenSpec AGENTS.md](../../openspec/AGENTS.md) - Change workflow
- [Project Context](../../openspec/project.md) - Full project overview
- [Claude Code Docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) - Official skills documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not being used?

1. **Check name format:** Lowercase, hyphens only (no spaces/underscores)
2. **Verify description:** Must be under 1024 characters
3. **Validate YAML:** Proper frontmatter format
4. **Restart Claude Code:** May need to reload skills

### Skill conflicts?

If multiple skills overlap:
1. Make skills more specific
2. Clarify "when to use" sections
3. Merge related skills if appropriate

## Questions?

For skill-related issues:
- Check [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills)
- Review existing SKILL.md files for examples
- Test with simple tasks first
