## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Law Firm Registration

The system SHALL allow users to register law firms (escritÃ³rios) to group lawyers. All lawyers MUST belong to a law firm - there is no distinction between law firms and solo lawyers. For solo practitioners, the system creates a law firm with the same name as the lawyer.

- **THEN** the system rejects the deletion
- **AND** the system displays an error message indicating lawyers must be reassigned or deleted first

#### Scenario: Auto-create firm for solo lawyer

- **WHEN** a user creates a new lawyer and provides only the lawyer's name
- **THEN** the system creates an `Escritorio` with `nome = advogado.nome`
- **AND** the system associates the lawyer with this newly created firm
- **AND** the firm displays with a "(Solo)" badge in the UI

### Requirement: Lawyer Registration

The system SHALL allow users to register lawyers with their professional information including full name, OAB number, OAB state, CPF, and mandatory association with a law firm.

- **THEN** the system creates a new `Advogado` record in the database
- **AND** the system associates the lawyer with the selected `Escritorio` via `escritorioId`
- **AND** the system sets `idAdvogado` to NULL (to be auto-detected later)
- **AND** the system displays a success message

- **WHEN** a user updates a lawyer's name, OAB, or CPF in the lawyer detail modal
- **THEN** the system updates the `Advogado` record
- **AND** the system preserves the `idAdvogado` value if it was previously auto-detected
- **AND** all associated credentials remain linked
- **AND** the accordion updates to reflect the new lawyer name

#### Scenario: Update law firm name for solo lawyer

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: List all firms and solo lawyers

**Reason**: Merged with "List all firms" scenario in the modified "Law Firm Registration" requirement. The system no longer distinguishes between firms and solo lawyers.

**Migration**: The modified requirement's "List all firms" scenario covers this functionality with a unified approach (solo lawyers appear as single-lawyer firms with a badge).

### Requirement: Register solo lawyer without firm

**Reason**: Removed because the system now auto-creates a law firm for solo lawyers instead of allowing NULL `escritorioId`.

**Migration**: The modified "Lawyer Registration" requirement includes "Register solo lawyer auto-creates firm" scenario that handles this case automatically.

### Requirement: Move lawyer between firm and solo

**Reason**: Removed because there is no longer a "solo" state (all lawyers belong to a firm).

**Migration**: Lawyers can be moved between firms by updating `escritorioId`, but they cannot have NULL `escritorioId`. Covered by existing "Update lawyer information via modal" scenario.

### Requirement: Select firm and view lawyers

**Reason**: Replaced by the new accordion pattern in the "Credentials Management UI" requirement.

**Migration**: The "Expand firm to view lawyers" scenario covers this functionality with an improved UX (collapsible accordion instead of cascading cards).

### Requirement: Select lawyer and view credentials

**Reason**: Replaced by the modal pattern in the "Credentials Management UI" requirement.

**Migration**: The "Open lawyer detail modal" and "View credentials in modal" scenarios provide this functionality with better visual organization.

### Requirement: Add new credential via UI

**Reason**: Merged into the "Credentials Management UI" requirement under "Add new credential via modal" scenario.

**Migration**: Functionality remains the same, but accessed via modal instead of a separate card.

### Requirement: Edit credential via UI

**Reason**: New functionality added in this change. Previously only delete was supported.

**Migration**: The "Edit credential in modal" scenario provides this new capability.

### Requirement: Delete credential via UI

**Reason**: Merged into the "Credentials Management UI" requirement under "Delete credential via modal" scenario.

**Migration**: Functionality remains the same, but accessed via modal instead of a separate card.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Solo Practice Badge Indicator

The system SHALL visually indicate when a law firm represents a solo practice (single lawyer) with a badge in the UI.

#### Scenario: Display solo badge for single-lawyer firms

- **WHEN** a law firm has exactly one associated lawyer
- **THEN** the system displays a "(Solo)" badge next to the firm name in the accordion
- **AND** hovering over the badge shows a tooltip: "This is a solo practice"

#### Scenario: Remove solo badge when second lawyer added

- **WHEN** a second lawyer is added to a previously solo firm
- **THEN** the system removes the "(Solo)" badge from the firm name
- **AND** the firm is displayed without any special indicator

#### Scenario: Restore solo badge when lawyers removed

- **WHEN** lawyers are removed from a multi-lawyer firm leaving only one lawyer
- **THEN** the system re-displays the "(Solo)" badge next to the firm name

### Requirement: Data Migration for Solo Lawyers

The system SHALL provide a migration script to convert existing solo lawyers (those with NULL `escritorioId`) into single-lawyer firms before enforcing the required `escritorioId` constraint.

#### Scenario: Migrate solo lawyers to firms

- **WHEN** the migration script is executed
- **THEN** the system identifies all `Advogado` records with `escritorioId = NULL`
- **AND** for each solo lawyer, creates an `Escritorio` with `nome = advogado.nome`
- **AND** updates the `Advogado.escritorioId` to reference the newly created firm
- **AND** logs a summary of created firms and affected lawyer IDs

#### Scenario: Handle migration errors gracefully

- **WHEN** the migration script encounters a database error (e.g., unique constraint violation)
- **THEN** the system logs the error with details (lawyer ID, error message)
- **AND** the system continues processing remaining solo lawyers
- **AND** the system reports total successes and failures at the end

#### Scenario: Rollback migration if needed

- **WHEN** the rollback script is executed
- **THEN** the system identifies all `Escritorio` records created by the migration (via timestamp or migration flag)
- **AND** the system sets the associated `Advogado.escritorioId` back to NULL
- **AND** the system deletes the auto-created `Escritorio` records
- **AND** the system logs the rollback summary

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Database Schema

The system SHALL implement the following database schema for credentials management with a required `escritorioId` field for all lawyers.

#### Scenario: Escritorio table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates an `Escritorio` table with columns: id (UUID), nome (String), createdAt (DateTime), updatedAt (DateTime)

#### Scenario: Advogado table structure with required escritorioId

- **WHEN** the database is initialized or migrated
- **THEN** the system creates an `Advogado` table with columns: id (UUID), nome (String), oabNumero (String), oabUf (String), cpf (String), idAdvogado (nullable String), escritorioId (String FK - REQUIRED), createdAt (DateTime), updatedAt (DateTime)
- **AND** the system creates a unique constraint on `[oabNumero, oabUf]`
- **AND** the system creates an index on `cpf`
- **AND** the system creates a foreign key relationship with `Escritorio` with SET NULL on delete
- **AND** the system enforces NOT NULL constraint on `escritorioId`

#### Scenario: Credencial table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates a `Credencial` table with columns: id (UUID), senha (String), descricao (nullable String), ativa (Boolean default true), advogadoId (String FK), createdAt (DateTime), updatedAt (DateTime)
- **AND** the system creates a unique constraint on `[advogadoId, senha]`
- **AND** the system creates a foreign key relationship with `Advogado` with cascade delete

#### Scenario: CredencialTribunal table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates a `CredencialTribunal` table with columns: id (UUID), tipoTribunal (String enum: "TRT"|"TJ"|"TRF"|"Superior"), validadoEm (nullable DateTime), credencialId (String FK), tribunalConfigId (String FK)
- **AND** the system creates a unique constraint on `[credencialId, tribunalConfigId]`
- **AND** the system creates foreign key relationships with `Credencial` and `TribunalConfig` with cascade delete
