# PJE Credentials Management - Specification Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Law Firm Registration

The system SHALL allow users to register law firms (escrit√≥rios) to group multiple lawyers, or operate as solo lawyers without a firm.

#### Scenario: Update firm information

- **WHEN** a user updates a firm's name
- **THEN** the system updates the `Escritorio` record
- **AND** all lawyers associated with the firm remain linked

#### Scenario: Delete firm with no lawyers

### Requirement: Lawyer Registration

The system SHALL allow users to register lawyers with their professional information including full name, OAB number, OAB state, CPF, and optional association with a law firm.

#### Scenario: Register new lawyer with firm

- **WHEN** a user submits a form with valid lawyer information (nome, oabNumero, oabUf, cpf) and selects a firm
- **THEN** the system creates a new `Advogado` record in the database
- **AND** the system associates the lawyer with the selected `Escritorio` via `escritorioId`
- **AND** the system sets `idAdvogado` to NULL (to be auto-detected later)
- **AND** the system displays a success message

#### Scenario: Register solo lawyer without firm

- **WHEN** a user submits a form with valid lawyer information without selecting a firm
- **THEN** the system creates a new `Advogado` record with NULL `escritorioId`
- **AND** the lawyer appears in the "Solo Lawyers" section

#### Scenario: Prevent duplicate OAB registration

- **WHEN** a user attempts to register a lawyer with an OAB number and UF combination that already exists
- **THEN** the system rejects the registration

- **AND** the system associates the credential with the specified lawyer via `advogadoId`
- **AND** the system sets the credential as active by default
- **AND** the system does NOT store CPF (CPF comes from the parent Advogado)

#### Scenario: Prevent duplicate password for same lawyer

- **WHEN** a user attempts to create a credential with a password that already exists for the same lawyer
- **THEN** the system rejects the creation
- **AND** the system displays an error message indicating the password is already registered for this lawyer

#### Scenario: List credentials for a lawyer

- **AND** the system suggests re-testing the credential

### Requirement: Tribunal Association

The system SHALL allow users to associate password credentials with specific tribunals and tribunal types.

#### Scenario: Associate credential with multiple tribunals

- **WHEN** a user selects multiple tribunals (e.g., TRT3-1g, TRT4-1g, TRT5-1g) for a credential
- **THEN** the system creates a `CredencialTribunal` record for each selected tribunal
- **AND** the system sets the appropriate `tipoTribunal` value ("TRT", "TJ", or "TRF")
- **AND** the system prevents duplicate associations for the same credential and tribunal

#### Scenario: Remove tribunal association

- **AND** the associated lawyer's `idAdvogado` field is already populated
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT query the profile API again
- **AND** the system uses the stored `idAdvogado` value

#### Scenario: Handle detection failure

- **WHEN** the system attempts to detect `idAdvogado` but the API request fails
- **THEN** the system logs a warning
- **AND** the system continues with the login process
- **AND** the system leaves `idAdvogado` as NULL for retry on next login

### Requirement: Credential Retrieval for Automation Scripts

The system SHALL provide a way for automation scripts to retrieve the appropriate credentials for a given tribunal.

#### Scenario: Retrieve credential for a specific tribunal

- **WHEN** an automation script requests credentials for a specific tribunal (e.g., TRT3-1g)
- **THEN** the system queries the database for active credentials associated with that tribunal

- **AND** the system displays a success message with the lawyer's name from PJE

#### Scenario: Test credential for TJ successfully

- **WHEN** a user initiates a credential test for a TJ tribunal

### Requirement: Database Schema

The system SHALL implement the following database schema for credentials management.

#### Scenario: Escritorio table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates an `Escritorio` table with columns: id (UUID), nome (String), createdAt (DateTime), updatedAt (DateTime)

#### Scenario: Advogado table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates an `Advogado` table with columns: id (UUID), nome (String), oabNumero (String), oabUf (String), cpf (String), idAdvogado (nullable String), escritorioId (nullable String FK), createdAt (DateTime), updatedAt (DateTime)
- **AND** the system creates a unique constraint on `[oabNumero, oabUf]`
- **AND** the system creates an index on `cpf`
- **AND** the system creates a foreign key relationship with `Escritorio` with SET NULL on delete

#### Scenario: Credencial table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates a `Credencial` table with columns: id (UUID), senha (String), descricao (nullable String), ativa (Boolean default true), advogadoId (String FK), createdAt (DateTime), updatedAt (DateTime)
- **AND** the system creates a unique constraint on `[advogadoId, senha]`
- **AND** the system creates a foreign key relationship with `Advogado` with cascade delete

#### Scenario: CredencialTribunal table structure

- **WHEN** the database is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates a `CredencialTribunal` table with columns: id (UUID), tipoTribunal (String enum: "TRT"|"TJ"|"TRF"), validadoEm (nullable DateTime), credencialId (String FK), tribunalId (String FK)
- **AND** the system creates a unique constraint on `[credencialId, tribunalId]`
- **AND** the system creates foreign key relationships with `Credencial` and `Tribunal` with cascade delete

### Requirement: No Environment Variable Fallback

The system SHALL NOT support environment variables for credentials - database is the single source of truth.

#### Scenario: Environment variables are ignored

- **WHEN** an automation script starts
- **AND** environment variables `PJE_CPF` and `PJE_PASSWORD` are set
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT use these values
- **AND** the system queries the database exclusively for credentials

#### Scenario: Error when no database credentials exist

- **WHEN** an automation script requests credentials for a tribunal
- **AND** no credentials exist in the database
- **THEN** the system throws a clear error message
- **AND** the error message instructs the user to configure credentials via `/pje/credentials`

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Interactive Login Functionality

**Reason**: The interactive login page is being removed because each automation script performs its own login, making a persistent login session unnecessary and misleading.

**Migration**: Users should use the new credentials management page to store their credentials, which will be automatically used by automation scripts.

### Requirement: Environment Variable Credential Storage

**Reason**: Environment variables (`PJE_CPF`, `PJE_PASSWORD`) are being completely removed in favor of database-driven credentials management.

**Migration**: System is in development, no migration needed. All credentials must be configured via the UI at `/pje/credentials`.
