# Add PJE Scraping Interface

## Why

Now that we have the credentials management system and multi-tribunal support in place, users need a way to execute scraping operations through the web interface. Currently, scraping scripts must be run manually via command line, which is not user-friendly and doesn't provide:

1. **Visual tribunal selection**: Users can't easily select which tribunals to scrape (single, multiple, or all)
2. **Scrape type configuration**: No interface to choose what to scrape (acervo geral, pendentes, arquivados, audiências)
3. **Sub-type selection**: For "Pendentes de Manifestação", users can't choose between "com dado ciência" vs "sem prazo"
4. **Execution control**: No way to start, monitor, pause, or cancel scraping jobs
5. **Progress tracking**: No real-time feedback on scraping progress
6. **History and results**: No persistent storage or UI to view scraping history and results

The scraping interface will enable lawyers to:
- Configure scraping jobs visually without touching code
- Execute scraping for one, multiple, or all tribunals at once
- Monitor execution progress in real-time
- View and export scraping results
- Review historical scraping executions

## What Changes

- Create new page: `app/(dashboard)/pje/scrapes/page.tsx` (currently a placeholder) with full scraping interface
- Add database models:
  - `ScrapeJob` - Represents a scraping execution (one or more tribunals)
  - `ScrapeJobTribunal` - Junction table tracking status per tribunal in a job
  - `ScrapeExecution` - Individual scraping runs per tribunal with logs and results
- Create scraping configuration component with:
  - Tribunal selection (individual, multiple, all TRTs, all TJs, all TRFs, or truly all)
  - Scrape type selection (Acervo Geral, Pendentes de Manifestação, Arquivados, Minha Pauta)
  - Sub-type options for Pendentes (com dado ciência, sem prazo)
- Implement backend job queue system for scraping execution
- Create server actions for:
  - Starting scraping jobs (`createScrapeJobAction`)
  - Canceling jobs (`cancelScrapeJobAction`)
  - Listing jobs and executions (`listScrapeJobsAction`)
  - Retrieving execution details and logs (`getScrapeExecutionAction`)
- Integrate with existing scraping scripts in `server/scripts/pje-trt/`
- Add real-time progress updates using polling or WebSocket (Phase 1: polling)
- Store scraping results in database with JSON field for process data
- Create UI components:
  - Job configuration form
  - Active jobs monitor with progress bars
  - Job history table with filtering
  - Execution detail view with logs and results

**BREAKING**: The placeholder scrapes page will be completely replaced with the full implementation.

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- `pje-scraping` (NEW) - Complete scraping interface and execution system

### Affected Code
- **Replaced**:
  - `app/(dashboard)/pje/scrapes/page.tsx` - Replace placeholder with full scraping interface

- **Modified**:
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add ScrapeJob, ScrapeJobTribunal, ScrapeExecution models
  - `app/actions/pje.ts` - Add scraping job management actions
  - `server/scripts/pje-trt/` - Modify scraping scripts to accept parameters and return structured results

- **Created**:
  - `components/pje/scrape-config-form.tsx` - Scraping configuration form
  - `components/pje/scrape-job-monitor.tsx` - Active jobs monitor
  - `components/pje/scrape-history.tsx` - Job history table
  - `components/pje/scrape-execution-detail.tsx` - Execution detail view
  - `lib/services/scrape-queue.ts` - Job queue management service
  - `lib/services/scrape-executor.ts` - Scraping execution orchestrator
  - `lib/types/scraping.ts` - TypeScript types for scraping
  - Database migration files

### Dependencies
- Depends on `add-pje-credentials-management` (needs credentials to authenticate)
- Depends on `add-trt-multi-tribunal-support` (needs tribunal configurations)
- Requires existing scraping scripts in `server/scripts/pje-trt/`
- May require job queue library (evaluate: BullMQ, bee-queue, or simple in-memory queue)

### Migration Path
- No migration needed - this is a new feature
- Existing command-line scraping scripts continue to work unchanged
